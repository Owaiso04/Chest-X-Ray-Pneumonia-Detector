# Chest X‑Ray Pneumonia Detector
 This project produces a tool that reads chest X ray images and flags those most likely to show pneumonia. It was trained equally on healthy and pneumonia cases and then fine tuned to pick up the subtle radiographic signs of infection. By setting an optimal decision threshold, it balances catching true pneumonia cases while minimizing false alarms. In a clinical setting, it can serve as a second reader—automatically highlighting X rays that warrant closer inspection or immediate follow up.
